# WQN Word Study v1 baseline

This contract freezes the shared word-learning semantics used by WQN and the
Note4 firmware. It is intentionally the first implementation of a reusable
study-session model; problems and notes may reuse the lifecycle later, but v1
accepts only the `word` domain.

## User semantics

Modes map to the internal model as follows:

| Visible mode | Purpose  | Ordering           |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------ |
| `sequential` | `study`  | `sequential`       |
| `random`     | `study`  | `guided_random_v1` |
| `dictionary` | `lookup` | `lexicographic`    |
| `review`     | `study`  | `due_queue_v1`     |
| `intake`     | `study`  | `new_intake_v1`    |
| `shuffle`    | `study`  | `pure_random_v1`   |
| `mistakes`   | `study`  | `mistake_words_v1` |

`dictionary` is retired on the device (AI lookup replaces the letter grid) and
remains in the enum for compatibility. All modes render the same word card.
Looking a word up does not by itself mutate learning progress. Only explicit
`known` and `unknown` observations do so; `shown`, `revealed`, `skipped`, and
`looked_up` remain append-only history. Stopping or pausing a session is not a
failure and there is no compulsory daily target. Every session declares a count
bound and can contain at most 500 items.

`guided_random_v1` is deterministic for the same candidate snapshot and seed.
It places due learning words, due review words, new words, not-yet-due words,
and mastered words into successive buckets, then orders items inside a bucket
by FNV-1a-64 of `seed + NUL + item_id`, with `item_id` as the collision tie-break.
The product exposes this simply as “random”; no recommendation reason is sent
or rendered.

`due_queue_v1` is the review queue: the selection is words due before the end
of today (Asia/Shanghai day boundary), and the order is learning (including
relearning) first, then due review words by `due_at` ascending, with deck order
and `sort_index` as tie-breaks. No bucketing, no hashing.

`new_intake_v1` selects unlearned words in deck order. The session slice is
bounded by the request's `new_word_limit` minus the number of words already
introduced today, so the daily new-word budget is enforced server-side.

`pure_random_v1` and `mistake_words_v1` order the eligible set by the same
FNV-1a-64 shuffle; they differ in selection (`pure_random_v1` walks the whole
non-mastered scope, `mistake_words_v1` only words the user has marked unknown).

`sequential` accepts an optional `start_index`: the server skips that many
candidates of the ordered scope and returns the next window, letting the device
continue a book walk across sessions.

## Device-side composition

The server never learns about the local replay pool: the review entry interleaves
a word the user marked `unknown` back into its own queue after at least five
answered cards (at most twice per word), and each such card is an ordinary
observation with a fresh `sequence`. Replaying is therefore legal by
`session_id + sequence` alone, and a device that loses the pool on reboot simply
keeps the FSRS schedule the `unknown` observation already wrote.

Only `review` has a completion state, and the device decides it locally: the
queue and the pool must both be empty. Sequential, shuffle, and mistakes are
open-ended walks that end on user exit, not on exhaustion.

## Reliability and ownership

- `StudySession` pins the exact deck revision and pack SHA used to build it.
  A downloaded replacement is staged for the next session and never rewrites
  an active session.
- `StudyObservation` is append-only. The server deduplicates by
  `user_id + request_id` and serializes observations by
  `session_id + sequence`.
- Device timestamps are clamped to `2000-01-01..server now`. Every observation
  is retained, while only one newer than `last_reviewed_at` updates projections;
  the response reports this with `projection_applied`.
- Creating a session retires the previous active/paused session for the same
  actor and mode. Sessions expire after 30 days and then stop pinning packs.
- The database RPC is the transaction boundary for observation, progress, the
  legacy review-event projection, and the wrong-word projection.
- Firmware will use a bounded durable outbox in W4. W0-W3 establish the wire,
  database, content, and session prerequisites without switching the current
  UI submission path.
- Word packs contain immutable content only. Progress and session state are
  separate small records.

## Fixed limits

- JSON counters: `0..9007199254740991` (IEEE-754 exact integer range).
- At most 500 candidates per session, 32 decks, and 100 candidate IDs per transport page. The default page
  is 32; the Note4 keeps a bounded three-page rolling window.
- At most 10,000 entries per pack, 4 MiB per uncompressed pack, and 8 KiB per
  JSONL line on device.
- `request_id`: 16-64 URL-safe characters; seed: 1-64 URL-safe characters.

The authoritative schema and golden fixtures live in this directory. Firmware
pins a byte-identical copy and schema hash. Text tie-breakers use UTF-8 byte
order (`TextEncoder` on the cloud and `std::string`/`strcmp` semantics on the
firmware), not JavaScript UTF-16 code-unit order; the supplementary-plane edge
case is covered by both ordering tests.
